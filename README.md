How to start the project:
- open Docker
- run the following command to setup the DB: ```docker-compose up -d```
- when docker is up and running go into the Mesi project folder and run the following command to update the DB: ```dotnet ef database update```
- then you can run the application


The Postman collection is not added because I've added Swagger endpoint documentation.

Thank you for your time
